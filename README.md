## Reflection
A studies project that was developed through the process of learning to work with reusbale infrastructure.
For this project I built infrastructure that can be used for other future game that I, or someone else, would want to develop.
The infrastructure is built on working with components, managers and interfaces for convenient implementation at the game code.

The game is a responsive Windows Desktop application, focus on building Windows 2D game with sounds, animations and game logic.
The game is for two or single player with option to expand for more players throw the infrastructure.
